- Descriptions : 
  - Halley : Worked on kata pages 1-3. Started on basic styling, such as having p tags, adding a button, and linking to the next page (10/18). Since we worked on the same one CSS sheet, I created a class for each body to have different background images. After, I centered and positioned images. I wanted the same styling for all texts and buttons for my pages, thus I created divs and classes to do so. Had trouble with the hover on the button and text-decoration. Realized that to change the text color on the hovers, the type selector needed to be the a tag and not the button tag (10/19). Changed titles for the pages and added description in alt atrributes (10/20).

  - Jared : I worked on the first 4 pages (including the index). I used basic tags at first then changed to div so I could distgush the classes eaiser. After writing the basic code and making the pages work properly, I finished the styling based of Halley's.
